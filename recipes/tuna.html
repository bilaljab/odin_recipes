    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <strong>tuna casserole</strong> that even my picky family loves! The potato chips give the casserole a crunchy crust.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen green peas </li>  
        <li>1 cup crushed potato chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes; drain.</li>

    </ol>
